For any kind of networking for a component we have to use some services 
Types of services
  clusterIP - exposes a set of ports to other components in kubernetis cluster
  NodePort - exposes a set of port to outside world (development purpose)
  LoadBalancer 
  Ingres 


kubectl apply -f k8s - build all config file inside the directory k8s

worker deployment dosen't need a service component of type CLusterIp, because no other object needs to connect
to the worker. But worker has to connect to other objects.
